Complete Projects
These are the projects I've taken from initial concept all the way through to working software. Each one represents a complete development cycle - planning, building, testing, and refining until I had something I was genuinely proud to share.
They showcase the technical skills I've developed and demonstrate my ability to see ideas through to completion. More importantly, they reflect the lessons learned from actually finishing what I started, which is often the hardest part of any project.
