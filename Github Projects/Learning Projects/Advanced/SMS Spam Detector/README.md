# SMS Spam Detector

A classic machine learning project for text classification, built to distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones ("ham") using Python and scikit-learn.

## Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to solve a common problem: spam filtering. The goal was to build an end-to-end workflow, from loading and cleaning data to training a classifier and testing its performance.

It uses a Naive Bayes classifier, a simple yet powerful algorithm well-suited for text-based tasks, to learn the patterns that differentiate spam from ham.

## What I Learned

  - **Text Vectorization**: Converting text messages into numerical features using the Bag-of-Words model (`CountVectorizer`).
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Implementing and training a probabilistic model for text classification.
  - **Scikit-learn Pipelines**: Building a clean, reusable workflow that chains preprocessing and modeling steps.
  - **Data Handling**: Loading, cleaning, and preparing text data for machine learning using Pandas.
  - **Unit Testing**: Writing tests with `pytest` to ensure the data loader and model behave as expected.

## Technical Stack

  - **Python**: Core programming language
  - **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning pipeline and model
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations
  - **Pytest**: For running the automated tests

### Key Concepts Applied

The core of the model is a `scikit-learn` Pipeline, which automates the workflow of turning raw text into predictions. This ensures that the same steps are applied consistently during both training and prediction.

```python
# The model pipeline from spam_detector/model.py
self.model = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
    ('classifier', MultinomialNB()),
])
```

## How It Works

The process is straightforward:

1.  **Load Data**: The `spam.csv` dataset, containing thousands of labeled messages, is loaded into memory.
2.  **Vectorize**: Each message is converted into a numerical vector. Each element in the vector represents the count of a specific word in the message. For example, the message "Free prize now" becomes a collection of counts for the words "free," "prize," and "now."
3.  **Train**: The `MultinomialNB` classifier analyzes these vectors. It learns the probability of each word appearing in a spam message versus a ham message. For instance, it learns that words like "free," "URGENT," and "claim" are far more likely to appear in spam.
4.  **Predict**: When given a new message, the trained model calculates the overall probability of it being spam or ham based on the words it contains and makes a classification.

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/username/sms-spam-detector.git
cd sms-spam-detector

# (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python main.py

# Run the tests (optional)
pytest
```

## Requirements

You can install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

**`requirements.txt`**

```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pytest
```

  - Python 3.8 or higher

## Sample Output

Running the demo script will train the model on the provided `spam.csv` and then classify a few example messages.

```
--- Running Spam Detector Demo ---

[1] Loading data from 'data/spam.csv'...
    Data loaded successfully. Found 38 messages.

[2] Training the Spam Detector model...
    Model training complete.

[3] Making predictions on new messages:

  Message: "Congratulations! You've won a $1,000 Walmart gift card. Go to http://example.com to claim now."
    -> Prediction: ðŸš¨ SPAM

  Message: "Hey mom, I'm going to be late for dinner tonight. See you in a bit."
    -> Prediction: âœ… HAM

  Message: "URGENT: Your account has been suspended due to suspicious activity. Please click here to reactivate."
    -> Prediction: ðŸš¨ SPAM
```

## What I Found Interesting

  - It's amazing how effective a relatively simple probabilistic model like Naive Bayes is for this task.
  - The "Bag of Words" approach, despite ignoring grammar and word order, provides enough signal to achieve high accuracy.
  - Data cleaning is critical. The project initially failed due to missing values (`NaN`) and improperly formatted CSV rows, highlighting that real-world data is rarely perfect.
  - Words like "free," "win," "prize," "urgent," and "claim" are incredibly strong predictors of spam, which the model picks up on automatically.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a main package `spam_detector` with clear separation of concerns.

    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â””â”€â”€ test_model.py       # Pytest suite for the model and data handler
```

## Things I'd Improve

  - **Use TF-IDF Vectorization**: Instead of simple word counts, use Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which gives more weight to words that are important to a message but not common across all messages.
  - **Try Other Models**: Experiment with other classifiers like Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to compare performance.
  - **Build an API**: Wrap the model in a simple Flask or FastAPI interface to allow for predictions via HTTP requests.
  - **Expand the Dataset**: Use a larger, more comprehensive dataset to build a more robust and accurate model.
