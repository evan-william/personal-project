## Advanced Projects

These are the projects that challenged me the most. I've applied what I know to solve more complex, practical problems and started thinking more like a developer.

They're not quite production-ready yet, but they show how I'm improving and growing my skills.

**Key focuses:**
- Complex problem solving
- Advanced programming concepts
- Real-world application development
- Technical skill advancement
