You're right, it does look awkward having the animated text above the section heading. It breaks the natural flow and makes the hierarchy confusing.

Here's a cleaner version:

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Projects

These are the projects that **challenged me the most**. I've applied what I know to solve more **complex, practical problems** and started thinking more like a developer.

They're not quite **production-ready** yet, but they show how I'm improving and growing my skills.

The animated text works better as a supporting element after the main content, not as a replacement for or precursor to the actual heading.
