# 📊 NumPy Sales Data Analysis

A Python project showing how to work with NumPy for data analysis. I built this to practice multi-dimensional arrays and statistical operations on sales data.

---

## ✨ What it does

This script creates fake sales data for a business with 5 products across 3 regions over one year. Then it runs various analyses to find patterns and insights.

The data has seasonal trends (higher sales during holidays) and random variations to make it realistic.

---

## 🔧 Key features

- Generates 3D array of sales data (365 days × 5 products × 3 regions)
- Calculates daily, monthly, and quarterly totals
- Finds correlations between different products
- Scores regional performance on 0-100 scale
- Identifies best/worst performing days and products

## 🚀 How to run

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### **Execution**
```bash
python sales_analysis.py
```

### **Sample Output**
```
NUMPY SALES DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
==================================================
1. FAKE DATA GENERATION
2. SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
3. ADVANCED ANALYTICS
4. PRODUCT CORRELATION MATRIX
5. PERFORMANCE SCORING SYSTEM
6. DATA EXPORT SIMULATION
7. KEY INSIGHTS
```

## 📈 NumPy skills demonstrated

- Working with 3D arrays and complex indexing
- Using axis parameters for different aggregation views
- Array reshaping for time-based analysis
- Broadcasting for applying seasonal patterns
- Manual correlation matrix calculation
- Z-score normalization and statistical operations

---

## 🎯 Why I made this

I wanted to practice NumPy beyond basic tutorials. This project covers real data analysis scenarios like:

- Handling multi-dimensional business data
- Time series analysis with seasonal patterns
- Statistical calculations without using pandas
- Performance optimization with vectorized operations

---

## 📊 What you'll see

The script outputs 7 sections of analysis showing different NumPy techniques in action. Each section focuses on specific array operations and statistical methods.

---

## ✅ Status

✔️ Working with NumPy 1.24+  
✔️ All calculations use pure NumPy (no pandas)  
✔️ Commented code explaining each step  
✔️ Realistic business data scenarios
