# Learning Projects

This is where I experiment, break things, and figure out how they work. I've split it into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** sections to track my progress step by step and see how my understanding has evolved over time.

These aren't polished applications - they're the raw process of learning made visible. Some are half-finished experiments, others are successful attempts at implementing concepts I'd only read about. Each one represents a moment when I decided to stop wondering "how does this work?" and start finding out.

The real value isn't in the final code, but in what I discovered while writing it. Every bug taught me something about debugging. Every successful feature showed me what was possible. Every abandoned project taught me about scope and planning.

This is where the messy, essential work of becoming a better programmer happens.
