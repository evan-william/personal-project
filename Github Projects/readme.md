# 🚀 My Coding Projects

This repo showcases two key parts of my coding journey:

### 🧩 Learning Projects  
Here’s where I experiment and grow. From beginner to advanced challenges, these projects are all about **trying new things**, **making mistakes**, and **getting better step by step**. They’re not perfect — but that’s the point!

### 🌟 Polished Projects  
These are the projects I’ve refined and feel proud to share. They highlight what I’ve learned and show the progress I’m making as a developer.


Every project, rough or polished, brings me closer to where I want to be. Thanks for stopping by and following along! 👨‍💻✨
