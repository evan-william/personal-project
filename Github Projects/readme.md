# My Coding Projects

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the coding world.

This repo is a snapshot of my journey, full of learning, building, and plenty of trial and error. Every project here represents a step forward in understanding how to write better code and solve real problems.

## Learning Projects

This is where I dive deep into new concepts and technologies. These projects might be rough around the edges, but they capture the process of figuring things out. From first attempts at algorithms to experimenting with frameworks I've never touched before - it's all about the learning process.

## Complete Projects  

These are the projects I've taken from initial idea all the way to working software. They showcase the skills I've developed and represent solutions to problems I actually wanted to solve. Each one taught me something valuable about planning, building, and finishing what I start.

Whether it's a messy experiment or a polished application, every project here has pushed my understanding forward in some way.

Thanks for checking it out!
