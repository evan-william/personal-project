# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm **Evan**, and this is where I keep all my coding projects and experiments.

From simple automation scripts to full applications - everything I build while learning and growing as a developer lives here. Some projects are practical tools, others are just me having fun with code.

**Feel free to explore, give feedback, or just see what I've been working on!**
